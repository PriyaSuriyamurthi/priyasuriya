# Project Overview

The project is to read the RSS feeds and display on the screen. There are 4 menu option and each will fetch the feed to display on the screen. 
The feed load is an asynchronous process. 

The main need for this project is to write test scripts and execute them.
Jasimine is used for this project to write test scripts.

# Test Scripts

Test scripts are written for HTML, CSS and Javascript.
1. Check is done to see if URL and name for the feed are defined, not empty and are of type string.
2. Check if the menu is hidden by default. The code is done in such a
way that class "menu-hidden" is available in the body tag, the menu is hidden and the menu is displayed when class "menu-hidden" is removed. 
Using the above logic, test scripts are written for default, when menu 
icon is clicked.
3. Check to see if the feed is loaded for the first feed name by default. 
There should be at least one feed data available.
4. Check to see if the feed details are updated when the menu option is clicked.
